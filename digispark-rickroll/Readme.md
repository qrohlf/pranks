# DigiSpark RickRoll

An Arduino sketch for the Digistump Digispark that will rickroll whatever machine the device is plugged into. Currently supports OSX.

# Background
- [Digispark dev board](http://digistump.com/products/1)
- [Digispark Keyboard Library](https://github.com/digistump/DigisparkArduinoIntegration/blob/master/libraries/DigisparkKeyboard/DigiKeyboard.h)

# Usage
*todo*

# Known Issues
The first time that a new keyboard is plugged into a mac, the mac opens a keyboard setup assistant. It would probably be a good idea to have a button on the device to automatically complete the keyboard setup assistant.
